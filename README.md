# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2018

The folders above each contain solutions to the advent of code 2018 challenges. I decided to complete the challenges in Ruby, mostly since I haven't had to use Ruby in a few years and I wanted to refamiliarise myself with the syntax.

One important note is I didn't really spend much time optimising, some of these solutions take a lot of time to get to so there were definitely cases where I knew a better, more efficient solution exists, I did not want to invest the time in perfecting them.

For any questions, please feel free to e-mail me at mikeyjc(at)gmail(dot)com.
